# tpmonitor

Want to turn power on and off based on the whether a PC/device is on or off? 

This is a shell script which will turn a tplink hs100 smart plug on and off, based on whether a device is found or not on the network.  It will monitor an IP address on the network, and turn a tp-link HS100 smart plug on or off accordingly.

This was adapted from the work George Georgovassilis https://blog.georgovassilis.com/2016/05/07/controlling-the-tp-link-hs100-wi-fi-smart-plug/ and Thomas Baust on understanding the plug commands and decrypting the output.
